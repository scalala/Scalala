The source currently lives on github.  You can download a copy:

  git clone https://github.com/scalala/Scalala.git

Scalala is built with sbt, which is included in the repository or
can be downloaded from https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki.

Run sbt (./sbt) and invoke one or more of the following targets:
  update      -- Downloads scalala's dependencies
  compile     -- Builds the library
  test        -- Runs the unit tests
  doc         -- Builds scaladoc for the public API
  proguard    -- Builds a distributable jar
  gen-idea    -- Generate an IntelliJ IDEA project

For project maintainers, the project can be deployed with:
  publish

To run an interactive console, either do so through sbt (console or
console-quick) or run sbt's proguard target, and then:
  java -jar target/scala_2.8.1/scalala*.min.jar
